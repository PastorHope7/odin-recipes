            <li>5 Tablespoonful tomato paste(very important)</li>
            <li>4 whole tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper (tatashe)</li>
            <li>2 scotch bonnets peppers/atarodo</li>
            <li>100ml vegetable oil</li>
            <li>About 600ml Meat or Chicken stock</li>
            <li>A small onion (sliced)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoonful ground crayfish(optional)</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon each of Thyme and curry</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, 
                scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor 
                or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure 
                that everything is blended well.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on 
                medium-high heat. Once the oil is heated add 
                the onions you set aside and fry just until 
                they turn golden brown. Once the onions, have 
                turned brown in color add the tomato paste and 
                fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato 
                mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside) and 
                fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for 
                about 30 minutes. Make sure you stir consistently so 
                that the tomato mixture does not burn.
            </li>
            <li>
                After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, 
                and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your 
                seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all 
                purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). 
                Continue to boil for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the parboiled rice to the pot. 
                Mix it very well with the tomato stew. 
                At this point if you need to add water so 
                that the rice is level with the tomato 
                mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. 
                Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook 
                on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the liquid has almost dried up add 
                the remaining tomato stew, cover, and let 
                it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat until 
                the liquid has completely dried up. Turn off 
                the heat, mix thoroughly, and your Jollof Rice 
                is ready to be eaten!
